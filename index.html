  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>As a highly motivated and detail-oriented software engineer, I bring a strong foundation in computer science and a passion for artificial intelligence and machine learning. With a Master's in Computer Science from the University of Cincinnati, I have developed a solid understanding of software development lifecycle, distributed systems, and cloud computing. My experience in full-stack web development, DevOps, and containerization has equipped me with the skills to design and implement scalable and efficient systems. I am excited to leverage my skills and knowledge to drive innovation and deliver high-quality solutions that meet the needs of users. I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends, and I am eager to collaborate with others to achieve common goals.</p>
